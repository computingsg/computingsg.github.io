    <h2>History</h2>
    <h3>Computing education winter in Singapore</h3>
    <h4>Teacher education</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>199x: small (typically 2-3 student teachers) batches of pre-service Computing in NIE (no Computing content, general pedagogy related to JC lecture-tutorial system)</li>
      <li>Late 199?: pre-service Computing ended in NIE (MOE says no demand)</li>
      <li>201x - present: NIE offers 2/3-hour unplugged technologies workshop for Computing teachers</li>
      <li>2015: To support the launch of the O-level Computing syllabus, Prof Ben Leong with CPDD Computing education unit started Computing Teachers Content Upgrading Course (CTCUC) to convert interested math or science teachers to teach O-level and A-level Computing. The inaugural batch graduated 20 teachers.</li>
      <li>2017: Last batch of CTCUC run by Prof Ben Leong and ESTL</li>
      <li>2018: No CTCUC</li>
      <li>2019-2020: CTCUC outsourced to polytechnics</li>
      <li>2021: No CTCUC. NIE prepares to run CTCUC as there was a Computing teacher seconded to NIE OER</li>
      <li>2022: NIE GPL ran CTCUC</li> 
      <li>2023: NIE does not have capacity to sustain CTCUC as seconded Computing teacher was posted back to school</li>
